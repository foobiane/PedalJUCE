# PedalJUCE: JUCE-powered guitar pedal emulation VST

**This project is still a work-in-progress. Expect bugs, malfunctions, and generally bad code.**

*Created by Ian Doherty and Josh Blustein, Summer 2025*

Desired Feature List:
* GUI workspace for connecting and modifying pedals, including their parameters (e.g., tone knobs)
* Diverse collection of pedal modules, including classic guitar effects pedals (e.g., distortion, tremolo) and new effects made possible via DSP (e.g., convolution)
* Preset system for both pedals and pedal arrangements
* Control via external devices and a context selection system (e.g., MIDI knobs control a selected pedal knob)
* Simple stereo IO system that hooks into and interacts with system IO
* Low latency processing
* Support for deployment into a Raspberry Pi system for live performance use
